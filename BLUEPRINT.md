# Monisha Inventory Management System - Complete Blueprint

## 🎯 How the System Works (Overview)

The Monisha Inventory Web App is designed to act as the central nervous system of the uniform business, ensuring that production, stock, school allocations, and sales all flow in a clear and connected way. At its core, the system is built around a **Batch-first approach**, which means everything begins from the production batches recorded in the warehouse.

### The Complete Business Flow

**When new uniforms are produced**, they are entered into the **Batch Inventory**. This is the central hub of the system, representing the real-life warehouse. Each batch contains important details such as the type of uniform (e.g., blazers, shirts, or trousers), the variants available (sizes, colors, gender), the quantities produced, and the cost price of production. Nothing is tied to a school at this point — it is simply a record of what has been manufactured and is now sitting in stock.

**From there**, the system allows managers or staff to move into the **Product Inventory**, which is where the school-level allocation begins. When adding a product here, the user must choose from the uniform types that exist in the Batch Inventory. For example, if a batch of "Navy Blue Blazers" was created in the warehouse, that uniform type will now appear in the Product Inventory's dropdown menu. Once selected, the system automatically loads the variants that were defined in the batch (for instance, blazer sizes S, M, and L). This prevents errors like adding uniforms that don't exist or inventing new sizes by mistake.

**The key difference** at this stage is that the product is now tied to a specific school. In other words, the Product Inventory doesn't just say "there are blazers in stock" — it says "St. Mary's School has 20 blazers allocated from Batch A." This allocation still traces back to the central Batch Inventory, so everything stays in sync between the warehouse and the schools.

**When schools (or individual customers) place orders**, the system checks the Product Inventory, which is already linked to the Batch Inventory. If stock is available, the system deducts it using the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle to ensure older stock is sold first. It then generates an order record with invoices, payment status, and delivery information. At the same time, both the school's allocation and the original batch balance are updated in real time, ensuring no "ghost stock" remains.

**The Dashboard and Reports** bring all of this together by giving managers an overview of the entire business: how much stock is left per batch, how many products are allocated per school, which uniforms are selling the most, and where profits are being made. This makes it easy to spot trends, prevent shortages, and plan future production runs.

### Data Flow Summary

In summary, the Monisha Inventory Web App runs like a **waterfall of data**:

1. **Batch Inventory** (warehouse stock) is the starting point
2. **Product Inventory** (school allocation) flows directly from it
3. **Orders** flow from the product allocations
4. **Reports** flow from everything

By keeping **Batch Inventory as the center of truth**, the app guarantees that every product added, every order processed, and every report generated is grounded in real stock that physically exists. This prevents errors, saves time, and provides a professional system for managing uniforms across multiple schools.

```

### Data Relationships & Inventory Architecture

#### Core Inventory Concept
The system uses a **two-tier inventory architecture**:
1. **Product Catalog** (`uniforms` + `uniform_variants`) - Defines WHAT can be sold
2. **Physical Inventory** (`batchInventory`) - Tracks WHAT is actually in stock

#### Relationship Flow
```
uniforms (1) ←→ (N) uniform_variants ←→ (N) batchInventory.items
    ↓                    ↓                        ↓
Product Info      Selling Prices         Physical Stock
```

#### Inventory Data Sharing Model
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[uniforms Collection] --> B[uniform_variants Collection]
    B --> C[batchInventory Collection]
    
    A --> D[Product Catalog<br/>- Name, Description<br/>- Category, Media]
    B --> E[Pricing & SKUs<br/>- Selling Prices<br/>- Size Variants]
    C --> F[Physical Stock<br/>- Actual Quantities<br/>- Cost Prices<br/>- Batch Tracking]
    
    G[Product Display] --> H[Combine All Three]
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
```

#### Critical Data Connections
- **uniformId**: Links variants to their parent uniform
- **variantId**: Links batch items to their variant specifications  
- **sku**: Unique identifier that connects all three systems
- **Atomic Updates**: When stock is sold, both batchInventory and orders are updated in a single transaction

### Inventory Data Synchronization

#### How the Three Systems Work Together

**1. Product Creation Process:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Create base uniform
const uniform = await addDoc(collection(db, 'uniforms'), {
  name: "School Blazer",
  category: "Outerwear",
  isActive: true
});

// Step 2: Create variants with pricing
const variant = await addDoc(collection(db, 'uniform_variants'), {
  uniformId: uniform.id,  // 🔗 CRITICAL LINK
  color: "Navy Blue",
  sizes: [
    { size: "S", price: 15.99, sku: "BLZR-NAVY-S" },
    { size: "M", price: 16.99, sku: "BLZR-NAVY-M" }
  ]
});

// Step 3: Add physical stock to batch
await updateDoc(doc(db, 'batchInventory', batchId), {
  items: arrayUnion({
    uniformId: uniform.id,    // 🔗 LINKS TO UNIFORM
    variantId: variant.id,    // 🔗 LINKS TO VARIANT
    sizes: [
      { size: "S", quantity: 50, sku: "BLZR-NAVY-S", price: 8.50 },
      { size: "M", quantity: 35, sku: "BLZR-NAVY-M", price: 9.00 }
    ]
  })
});
```

**2. Stock Calculation (Real-time):**
```javascript
// To get available stock for a SKU, sum across ALL batches
const getAvailableStock = async (sku) => {
  const batchesSnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'batchInventory'));
  let totalStock = 0;
  
  batchesSnapshot.docs.forEach(batchDoc => {
    const batch = batchDoc.data();
    batch.items.forEach(item => {
      item.sizes.forEach(sizeInfo => {
        if (sizeInfo.sku === sku) {
          totalStock += sizeInfo.quantity; // 📊 SUM ACROSS BATCHES
        }
      });
    });
  });
  
  return totalStock;
};
```

**3. Order Processing (Atomic Updates):**
```javascript
// When an order is placed, update stock atomically
const processOrder = async (orderItems) => {
  await runTransaction(db, async (transaction) => {
    // Read all relevant batches
    const batchRefs = await getDocs(collection(db, 'batchInventory'));
    
    for (const item of orderItems) {
      let remainingToDeduct = item.quantity;
      
      // Deduct from batches using FIFO (oldest first)
      for (const batchDoc of batchRefs.docs) {
        if (remainingToDeduct <= 0) break;
        
        const batchData = batchDoc.data();
        const batchItemIndex = batchData.items.findIndex(
          batchItem => batchItem.uniformId === item.uniformId && 
                      batchItem.variantId === item.variantId
        );
        
        if (batchItemIndex > -1) {
          const sizeIndex = batchData.items[batchItemIndex].sizes.findIndex(
            size => size.sku === item.sku
          );
          
          if (sizeIndex > -1) {
            const available = batchData.items[batchItemIndex].sizes[sizeIndex].quantity;
            const toDeduct = Math.min(available, remainingToDeduct);
            
            // 🔄 UPDATE BATCH STOCK
            batchData.items[batchItemIndex].sizes[sizeIndex].quantity -= toDeduct;
            remainingToDeduct -= toDeduct;
            
            transaction.update(batchDoc.ref, { items: batchData.items });
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
    // 📝 CREATE ORDER RECORD
    transaction.set(doc(collection(db, 'orders')), {
      items: orderItems,
      status: 'pending',
      createdAt: new Date()
    });
  });
};
```

#### Key Integration Points

| System | Purpose | Key Fields | Links To |
|--------|---------|------------|----------|
| `uniforms` | Product Catalog | `id`, `name`, `category` | `uniform_variants.uniformId` |
| `uniform_variants` | Pricing & SKUs | `uniformId`, `id`, `sku`, `price` | `batchInventory.items.variantId` |
| `batchInventory` | Physical Stock | `items[].uniformId`, `items[].variantId`, `quantity` | Both above systems |

#### Data Consistency Rules

1. **Never sell without stock**: Always check `batchInventory` before allowing orders
2. **Use transactions**: Stock updates and order creation must be atomic
3. **FIFO principle**: Deduct from oldest batches first
4. **Price separation**: Customer sees `uniform_variants.price`, internal cost is `batchInventory.price`
5. **SKU uniqueness**: Same SKU across all systems ensures data integrity

## 🔧 API & Data Management

### Zustand Store Architecture
```javascript
// Core stores for domain separation
stores/
├── authStore.js        // Authentication & user management
├── uniformStore.js     // Uniform inventory operations  
├── schoolStore.js      // School and student management
├── batchStore.js       // Batch inventory management
├── orderStore.js       // Order and transaction management
├── reportStore.js      // Analytics and reporting
├── settingsStore.js    // Application configuration
└── rootStore.js        // Global state coordination
```

### Store Pattern Example
```javascript
export const useUniformStore = create((set, get) => ({
  // State
  uniforms: [],
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  
  // Actions
  getAvailableUniforms: async () => {
    try {
      set({ loading: true, error: null });
      const snapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'uniforms'));
      const uniforms = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
        id: doc.id,
        ...doc.data()
      }));
      set({ uniforms });
      return uniforms;
    } catch (error) {
      set({ error: error.message });
      throw error;
    } finally {
      set({ loading: false });
    }
  },
  
  addUniform: async (uniformData) => {
    // Implementation with optimistic updates
  },
  
  updateUniform: async (id, updates) => {
    // Implementation with conflict resolution
  }
}));
```

### Firebase Integration Patterns
```javascript
// Real-time listeners
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(
    collection(db, 'uniforms'),
    (snapshot) => {
      const uniforms = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
        id: doc.id,
        ...doc.data()
      }));
      setUniforms(uniforms);
    }
  );
  return unsubscribe;
}, []);

// Atomic transactions
const processOrder = async (orderData) => {
  await runTransaction(db, async (transaction) => {
    // 1. Read current stock
    // 2. Verify availability  
    // 3. Update stock levels
    // 4. Create order record
  });
};
```

## 🔒 Security & Performance

### Security Measures
```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules Example
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own profile
    match /inventory_managers/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Only managers can modify inventory
    match /uniforms/{uniformId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/inventory_managers/$(request.auth.uid));
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Offline Persistence**: Firestore local caching
- **Lazy Loading**: Component-level code splitting
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format with fallbacks
- **Bundle Splitting**: Vendor and app code separation
- **Caching Strategy**: Store-level data caching with TTL
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback

### Data Integrity
- **Atomic Transactions**: Stock updates and order creation
- **Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Audit Trails**: Complete change history
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated Firestore backups
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and retry logic
